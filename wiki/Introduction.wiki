= Introduction =

RzDash is based on Arduino, it uses an Arduino Mega module to process and display data.

* The hardware is based on a few simple things: *

 * Arduino Mega
 * KS0108 Graphic LCD
 * Arduino Mega proto shield
 * 5V switching power supply (based on a LM2575 ic)
 * a floppy flat cable to connect the LCD (ATA 33)

I'm using a special library to drive the LCD. It uses a frame buffer to accelerate display, it's twice as fast.

== Why ? ==

I searched on the web for such systems, I did not find anything that had the features I wanted.
It's pretty easy to datalog a Honda ECU, all you need is a custom rom with datalog enable, a serial ttl to USB cable, a laptop and that's it.

The problem is, I wanted to keep an eye on my engine's constants while driving, without the hassle of having a laptop in my car.

The other reason is that I didn't want to turn my car into a "night club" with 10 gauges flashing on the dash. One screen to display all the info, and only the info I want is way better.
