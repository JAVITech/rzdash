RzDash is based on Arduino, it uses an Arduino Mega module to process and display data.

* The hardware is based on a few simple things: *

 * Arduino Mega
 * KS0108 Graphic LCD
 * Arduino Mega proto shield
 * 5V switching power supply (based on a LM2575 ic)
 * a floppy flat cable to connect the LCD (ATA 33)

I'm using a special library to drive the LCD. It uses a frame buffer to accelerate display, it's twice as fast.
